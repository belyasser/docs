# Connecting an Omega2 Board

Follow the instructions below to connect your device to the [Cloud4RPi](https://cloud4rpi.io) control panel.

## Prerequisites

Install/update the required packages.

```sh
opkg update
opkg install wget python3 python3-pip
pip3 install --upgrade setuptools pip
```

You can use alternative methods to [install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing.html).

!!! Note
    The Cloud4RPi library is compatible with Python 3.2+ and Python 2.7.9+ versions.

## Getting the Cloud4RPi Client Library

Install the library using your preferred Python version. The following command installs and integrates Cloud4RPi with your OS's default Python interpreter (usually Python 3):

```sh
pip3 install cloud4rpi
```

## Hacking Together some Code

We have prepared sample code for several platforms in the [cloud4rpi-omega2-python](https://github.com/cloud4rpi/cloud4rpi-omega2-python) repository to demonstrate sending data to the Cloud.

Get Cloud4RPi examples for your device:

```sh
mkdir cloud4rpi-omega2-python && cd cloud4rpi-omega2-python
repo="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloud4rpi/cloud4rpi-omega2-python/master"
wget "$repo/omega2.py" "$repo/control.py"
```

!!! Note
    You can install **git** if your board has sufficient memory and you prefer using it, and clone this repository with the following command: `opkg install git git-http ca-bundle && git clone https://github.com/cloud4rpi/cloud4rpi-omega2-python.git && cd cloud4rpi-omega2-python`

Before running a sample ([control.py](https://github.com/cloud4rpi/cloud4rpi-omega2-python/blob/master/control.py)), remember to replace the `__YOUR_DEVICE_TOKEN__` string with your real device token. Use a text editor (for instance, `vim`) to replace `__YOUR_DEVICE_TOKEN__` with the token displayed at the top of the device page on [cloud4rpi.io](https://cloud4rpi.io/). If you have no token yet, open the [Devices](https://cloud4rpi.io/devices) page, create a device using the **New Device** button in the top right corner, and use its token.


## Running

Execute the script with a Python interpreter, for example:

```sh
python3 control.py
```

!!! Note
    If you have installed Cloud4RPi to a non-default Python, use the version with the Cloud4RPi library.

If the script output looks right, open the [Devices](https://cloud4rpi.io/devices) page to see if the device status has changed.
